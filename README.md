# Static Routing–Based Network Design

## 📘 Project Overview

This project was dynamic routing, this design uses **manually configured static routes** to achieve end-to-end connectivity between multiple LANs and WAN links. The project highlights how static routing can be effectively used in small-to-medium-sized networks where topology changes are minimal.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Cisco Packet Tracer**
* **Static Routing (IPv4)**
* **IPv4 Subnetting**
* Cisco **1941 Routers**
* Cisco **2960 Switches**
* End devices (PCs)


## 🚀 How to Use

1. Install and open **Cisco Packet Tracer**
2. Load the file `Static Routing Network.pkt`
3. Review IP addressing on routers and PCs
4. Examine static route configurations on each router
5. Use **ping** and **traceroute** to verify connectivity between different networks
